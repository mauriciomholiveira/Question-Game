<br>


## 🦸🦸‍♀ About
#### The purpose of this project is to show a simple application where the user will ask a question about his destination and when clicking on the ***Ask Question*** button, he will return an answer.

#### This magic only happens because of ***JavaScript*** because it does all the work of showing a random response to the user.

#### Added elements such as a ***setTimeout*** in this project, where it makes the question disappear after 3 seconds.

#### Also added an opacity to the **transition**, making the ***Game Quest*** response smoother.
<br>

<br>

## 🔶 This project can be adapted for many other things, such as🔷
<br>

#### - Show a random number from one or more data,
#### - Draw a random number, used a lot for social media raffles.
#### - and many other things.
